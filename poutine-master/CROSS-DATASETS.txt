Each of our joins involve hdv_modeled.Results_Beam_DF and ers_modeled.Jurisdiction_Demography.
These tables will be joined on the basis of FIPS codes. We will be selecting different columns for each join.
Our 2nd dataset is quite clean, so we do not anticipate that data transforms will be necessary.

1. The first query will use a join between the following two tables: 
hdv_modeled.Results_Beam_DF and ers_modeled.Jurisdiction_Demograpy. The join
will be across the FIPS and fipscode fields. We will compare the voting results
in each jurisdiction with corresponding unemployment data for the given jurisdiction and year. 
The SQL operations required include a select statement, a join statement, a where statement, and a limit statement. 

2. The second query will compare voter turnout in each jurisdiction with electoral outcomes. 
We will need to use the division operator to perform this query, to compare
total_votes with population estimates for each jurisdiction in the correct year.
Again, we will use select, join, where, and limit.

3. Our final query will compare overall poverty estimates with voting results for
each jurisdiction in the 2018 House Election. We will seek to calculate an average
poverty level for party (i.e. Democrat, Republican) victories. This will require 
the aggregate function AVG. Hence, we will use select, join, group by, and limit.
