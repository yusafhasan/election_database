We want to investigate 2018 and 2016 general election data at 
the federal level. We hope to examine several election factors, 
including but not limited to, location, census characteristics 
(i.e. age, income, education) from a secondary dataset. We have
not located this secondary dataset yet, however.

The primary data is organized under the following sub-categories: 
state, jurisdiction, fipscode, office, year, party affiliation, candidate, and vote totals. 

Our proposed dataset is composed of 5 files:

1. 2016 House Results: Reports vote totals for each House race in the country,
   in the format described above.
2. 2016 Senate Results: Reports vote totals for each Senate race in the country,
   in the format described above.
3. 2016 Presidential Results: Reports vote totals for the Presidential election,
   in the format described above.
4. 2018 House Results: Reports vote totals for each House race in the country,
   encompassing the format described above.
5. 2018 Senate Results: Reports vote totals for each Senate race in the country,
   encompassing the format described above.
   
The overarching relationship between much of the dataset is many-to-many (m:n).
Jurisdiction:Office, Jursidiction:Candidate, State:Office, State:Candidate (presidential only)

There are also some one-to-many relationships (1:m).
State:District, Party:Candidate

The primary key for the 2016 data is the combination of state, jurisdiction, office,
and candidate. For the 2018 data, the primary key is fipscode, office, and candidate.

We can develop Jurisdiction, State, Party, Candidate, and Electoral Race tables, from this data.

For example: Jursidiction will have a primary key of fipscode and a foreign key of state; Candidate will have a primary key of candidate name and foreign key of party. Electoral Race will have a primary key of jurisdiction, office, and year, with foreign keys of state, jurisdiction, candidate.
This is only a demonstration, not exhaustive proof, that our datasets are capable of these primary key-foreign key relationships.

Since our focus is on federal elections, we did not choose to include the gubernatorial elections in our
proposed dataset, although the files are available there. Our dataset is composed of the "long" files, not
the "wide" type.






Secondary Dataset
Our secondary dataset is from the USDA Economic Research Service. It describes educational 
and economic statistics on a county basis over several years. While some data is from 1970-2018 or 2007-2018,
we will truncate the data to 2016 and 2018.

1. Educational Attainment: Presents information for each county based on year and educational attainment level 
(some high school or less, high school graduate, some college, college graduate, more than a 4 year degree). 
Information can be raw numbers or percentage of county population.

2. Unemployment and Median Household Income: Provides economic information for each county based on year. 
Gives the size of the civilian labor force, the number of employed adults, the number of unemployed adults, 
and the unemployment rate. However, the median household income is available only for 2018. This median
household income is also compared to the state median household income as a percentage.

3. Poverty estimates: This table gives different statistics on how to measure poverty in a county; however, 
these statistics only apply to 2018. They include 90% confidence intervals for the general population in poverty, 
as well as for different age groups (0-4, 5-17, 0-17). Both raw counts and percentages are available.

4. Population estimates: This table provides county-level population data by year. There are predicted 
population amounts in the years when a census was not conducted, as well as rates of population growth. 
The growth is further broken down into births, deaths, and migration. Raw numbers and percentages 
are available to measure rates of population growth.
